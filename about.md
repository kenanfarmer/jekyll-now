I am a Computer Scientist at Princeton University. I will be living in the northern Virigina Area (affectionately "NoVA") after graduation working for CapitalOne.

### Interests

I am a track and field D1 athlete.  I am interested in networks, machine learning and public policy surrounding these themes.
