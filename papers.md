A quick summary of each project or paper that I have independently worked on or created. 

- 2018 Independent Work:  My Senior Independent Work Project was titled "Hyerspectral Semantic Segmentation in Varying Satellite Resolutions." Though quite a mouthful, it means I evaluated various Neural Network models at varying satellite resolutions to measure their performance dropoff. I evaluated U-Net, and varying types of SegNet.
