A quick summary of each project or paper that I have independently worked on or created. 

- 2018 Independent Work:  My Senior Independent Work Project is titled "Hyerspectral Semantic Segmentation in Varying Satellite Resolutions." What that means is, I evaluated various Neural Network's performance in the task of outlining buildings in satellite images. I measured each model's performance dropoff as satellite image quality worsened. The Models that I evaluated were variations of U-Net and SegNet.
    - I learned a gread deal from this project

- WireGuard VPN: I setup and am running a WireGuard VPN server in Amazon's UK datacenter. I did this to better understand and experiment with VPN services as well as cloud infrastructure. A write-up on this project is coming soon.

note: This has nothing to do with wanting to watch BBC for free(though I have been asked if this is why) and any acusation is expressly denied.
