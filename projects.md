A quick summary of each project or paper that I have independently worked on or created. 

- 2018 Independent Work:  My Senior Independent Work Project is titled "Hyerspectral Semantic Segmentation in Varying Satellite Resolutions." What that means is, I evaluated various Neural Network's performance in the task of outlining buildings in satellite images. I measured each model's performance dropoff as satellite image quality worsened. The Models that I evaluated were variations of U-Net and SegNet.

- WireGuard VPN: I setup and am running a WireGuard VPN server in Amazon's UK datacenter. I did this to better understand and experiment with VPN services as well as cloud infrastructure. A write-up on this project is coming soon.

Note: I have been asked if this is a way to get around state-imposed restrictions. WireGuard VPN is still being developed and thus should not be used till mature. It is a great way to experiment and learn. A good quick start guide was covered by TechCrunch [here](https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/28/how-i-made-my-own-wireguard-vpn-server/) along with Ansible scripts [here](https://github.com/trailofbits/algo)

<!-- - WMATA Clone <In progress> Curious about NFC and RFID protocols and tired of carying MetroCards around, I contacted WMATA to see if I could make an app that clones/replays MetroCard ids to their RFID recievers. I experimented with the Swift language, RFID documentation, and starting my own OpenSource Project.

the trello board for tracking this project's progress is here: <a href="">MetroCard</a> -->
