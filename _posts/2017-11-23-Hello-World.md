title: Better Blogs than this
---


#******* UNDER CONSTRUCTION  excuse the mess + clutter **************

# Why?
I hate blogs. Not all blogs but ones that repeat what others say. So as I figure out what I want this to be, I'll display a list of my favorite engineering blogs so I don't repeat them.

# What?
TBD but in the meantime heres a collection of Technical Blogs that I use frequently broken into categories (Note: nothing reall ybeats finding papers in the research area of interest and then looking at the papers they commonly cite) 

[The Morning Paper](https://blog.acolyer.org/) is a good summary of cutting edge papers in Computer Science every workday boiling them to ~10min reads. 
[Corporate Engineering Blogs](https://github.com/kilimchoi/engineering-blogs) is a summary of general tech blogs from companies and individuals (I do not focus on these as it gets crazy to keep track of ~350 company Engineering blogs)

# Distributed Systems/Infrastructure
- [Werner Vogel's Blog](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/) if you recognize that name its because he's the CTO of Amazon. His blog focuses on distributed computing and touch on many 
- [Ian Miell](https://zwischenzugs.com/) Author of Docker In Practice, and one of the best resources for infrastructure as code practices


# Scientific Computing and Machine Learning
- [jakevdp Blog](https://jakevdp.github.io/) a fanatastic numerical Python blog by the director of open software at the University of Washington's eScience Institute
- [Andrew Trask's Blog](https://iamtrask.github.io/) one of the top

# Misc.
- [The Down Linq](https://medium.com/the-downlinq) this is the main blog of IN-Q-TEL that I follow but they are all interesting

protip: when reading papers on [Arxiv](www.arxiv.org) use [Arxiv vantiy](https://www.arxiv-vanity.com)
