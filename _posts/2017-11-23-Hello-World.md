This will be a markdown document allowing code snippits and static content. I will write about my experiences with TensorFlow and the various questions I had along the journey of bridging Deep learning reasearch and practice. 
```python
import tensorflow as tf

print('TensorFlow works! Hello World!')
```
Best of luck!
